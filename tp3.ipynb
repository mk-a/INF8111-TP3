    "## Market Basket Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Market Basket Analysis (MBA) is a data mining analytics technique to uncover associations between products or product grouping. By exploring interesting patterns from an extensive collection of data, MBA aims to understand/reveal customer purchase behaviors based upon the theory that if you purchased a certain set of products, then you are more (or less) likely to buy another group of products. In other words, MBA allows retailers to identify the relationship between the items that customers buy, revealing patterns of items often purchased together.\n",
    "\n",
    "A widely approach to explore these patterns is by constructing ***association rules*** such as:\n",
    "- **if** bought *ITEM_1* **then** will buy *ITEM_2* with **confidence** *X*.\n",
    "\n",
    "These associations do not have to be 1-to-1 rules. They can involve many items. For example, a person in a supermarket may add eggs to his/her cart, then an MBA application may suggest that the person will also buy some bread and/or flour: \n",
    "    \n",
    "+ **if** bought *EGGS* **then** will buy [*BREAD* with confidence *0.2*; *FLOUR* with confidence 0.05].\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if the person now decides to add flour to his/her cart, the new association rule could be as showing below, suggesting ingredients to make a cake.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ **if** bought [*EGGS, FLOUR*] **then** will buy [*SUGGAR* with confidence 0.45; BAKING POWDER with confidence 0.12; *BREAD* with confidence *0.03*].\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many real scenarios where MBA plays a central role in data analysis, such as supermarket transactions, online orders or credit card history. Marketers may use these association rules to allocate correlated products close to each other on store shelves or make online suggestions so that customers buy more items. Some questions that an MBA can usually help retailers to answer are:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - What items are often purchased together?\n",
    "    - Given a basket, what items should be suggested?\n",
    "    - How should items be placed together on the shelves?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "Your goal in this TP is to develop an MBA algorithm for revealing patterns by creating association rules in a big dataset with more than three millions supermarket transactions. However, mining association rules for large datasets is a very computationally intensive problem, which makes it almost impractical to perform it without a distributed system. Hence, to run your algorithm, you will have access to a distributed cloud computing cluster with hundreds of cores. \n",
    "\n",
    "To this end, a **MapReduce** algorithm will be implemented upon the [Apache Spark](http://spark.apache.org) framework, a fast cluster computing system. In a nutshell, Spark is an open source framework designed with a *scale-out* methodology which makes it a very powerful tool for programmers or application developers to perform a massive volume of computations and data processing in distributed environments. Sparks provides high-level APIs that make it easy to build parallel apps without needing to worry about how your code and data are parallelized/distributed thought the computing cluster. Spark does it all for you.\n",
    " \n",
    "The implementation will follow the Market Basket Analysis algorithm presented by Jongwook Woo and Yuhang Xu (2012). The image **workflow.svg** Illustrates the algorithm's workflow, and is to be used for consultation throughout this TP. The blue boxes are the ones where you must implement a method to perform a map or reduce function, and the grey boxes represent their expected output. **All these operations are explained in details in the following sections.** \n",

    "## 1. Setting up Spark\n",
    "\n",
    "Spark runs on both Windows and UNIX-like systems (e.g., Linux, Mac OS). It's easy to run locally on one machine — all you need is to have Java installed on your system PATH, or the JAVA_HOME environment variable pointing to a Java installation. It is recommended that you have the **JDK v8** installed in your system. If you haven't, go to [Java's web page](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) to download and install a Java Virtual Machine. Remember to set the environment variable JAVA_HOME if your installation does not do it automatically for you. \n",
    "\n",
    "The interface between Python and Spark is done through **PySpark**, which can be obtained following the sequence below:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First, go to http://spark.apache.org/downloads \n",
    "2. Select the newest Spark release and the Pre-built for Apache Hadoop 2.7 package \n",
    "3. Click for download **spark-2.4.4-bin-hadoop2.7.tgz** and unzip it in any folder of your preference. \n",
    "4. Next, export the following variables to link PYSPARK (Spark's python interface) to your python distribution in yout `~/.bash_profile` file.\n",
    "```\n",
    "    - export SPARK_HOME=/path/to/spark-2.4.4-bin-hadoop2.7\n",
    "    - export PYTHONPATH=\"$SPARK_HOME/python:$SPARK_HOME/python/lib/py4j-0.10.7-src.zip:$SPARK_HOME/python/lib/pyspark.zip:$PYTHONPATH\"\n",
    "    - export PYSPARK_PYTHON=/path/to/your/python3\n",
    "```\n",
    "5. Run `source ~./bash_profile` to effictate the changes and reinitializate this jupyter notebook session."

    "### 1.1 Product Counting Example \n",
    "\n",
    "To test your installation and start to get familiarized with Spark, we will follow an example that counts how many times the products of a toy dataset were purchased.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main entry point to start programming with Spark is the [RDD API](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/pyspark.html#pyspark.RDD), an excellent Spark abstraction to work with the MapReduce framework.  RDD is a collection of elements partitioned across the nodes of the cluster that can operate in parallel. In other words, RDD is how Spark keeps your data ready to perform some function (e.g., a map or reduce function) in parallel. **Do not worry if this still sounds confusing, it will be clear once you start implementing**. However, it is part of this TP to study/consult the [Spark python API](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/) and learn how to use it. Some useful functions that the RDD API offers are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **map**: return a new RDD by applying a function to each element of this RDD.\n",
    "2. **flatMap**: return a new RDD by first applying a function to all elements of this RDD, and then flattening the results. **Should be used when each entry will yield more than one mapped element**\n",
    "3. **reduce**: reduces the elements of this RDD using the specified commutative and associative binary operator.\n",
    "4. **reduceByKey**: merge the values for each key using an associative and commutative reduce function\n",
    "5. **groupByKey**: group the values for each key in the RDD into a single sequence\n",
    "6. **collect**: return a list that contains all of the elements in this RDD. **Should not be used when working with a lot of data**\n",
    "7. **sample**: return a sampled subset of this RDD\n",
    "8. **count**: return the number of elements in this RDD.\n",
    "9. **filter**: return a new RDD containing only the elements that satisfy a predicate."

    "\n",
    "In the example above, we briefly used a Spark's Dataframe class, but only to obtain an RDD object with ```toy.rdd``` and to print the data as a structured table with the ```show()``` function. However, [Dataframe](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/pyspark.sql.html#) is a big part of the current Spark release and is built upon the RDD API. It is a distributed collection of rows under named columns, the same as a table in a relational database. Spark's Dataframe works similarily as [Pandas'](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html). In fact, we can export (obtain) a Spark's data frame to (from) a pandas' data frame with the function ```toPandas()``` (```spark.createDataFrame```).\n",
    "\n",
    "A central functionality of the data frame is to profit from the [Spark SQL](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-programming-guide.html#sql), a module that allows SQL queries over structured data.

    "These SQL concepts are being mentioned here because they will be useful to us during the TP, mainly in Section 3, to manipulate the supermarket data, which is structured in data frames. Then, if you are not familiar with SQL, it is recommended that you follow a [tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/) to understand the basics.\n",

    " The following sections explain how you should develop each step of the MapReduce algorithm for our supermarket application. Figure workflow.png illustrates each step of the algorithm.\n",
    " \n",
    "### 2.1 Map to Patterns (10 points)\n",
    "For a given a set of transactions (i.e., the rows of our toy dataset), each transaction must be **mapped** into a set of *purchase patterns* found within the transaction. Formally, these patterns are subsets of products that represent a group of items bought together. \n",
    "    \n",
    "For the MapReduce framework, each pattern must be created as a *KEY-VALUE* element, where they KEY can take the form of a singleton, a pair or a trio of products that are present in the transaction. More precisely, for each transaction, the mapping function must generate all possible **unique** subsets of size **ONE, TWO or THREE**.  The VALUE associated with each KEY is the number of times that the KEY appeared in the transaction (if we assume that no product appears more than once in the transaction, this value is always equal to one). \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, implement the  **map_to_patterns** function that receives a transaction (a row from the data frame) and returns the patterns found in the transaction. The mapped elements are a tuple (KEY, VALUE), where KEY is also a tuple of product names. It is crucial to notice that, since each entry (transaction) of the map function will **yield** more than one KEY-VALUE element, a *flatMap* must be invoked for this step.\n",

However, creating the subpattern's KEY is a different procedure. This time, the idea is to break down the list of products of each pattern (pattern KEY), remove one product at a time, and yield the resulting list as the new subpattern KEY. \n",

Instead of just single integer value as we had in the patterns, this time a *tuple* should be created for the subpattern VALUE.

For the example above, the values should be ($p_1,v$), ($p_2,v$) and ($p_3,v$), respectively, where $v$ is the VALUE of the pattern. \n",

Furthermore, each pattern should also yield a subpattern where the KEY is the same list of products of the pattern, but the VALUE is a tuple with a null product (None) and the number of times the pattern appeared. This element will be useful to keep track of how many times such a pattern was found and later will be used to compute the confidence value when generating the association rules. \n",
